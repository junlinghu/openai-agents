# OpenAI Agents

The OpenAI Agents is a framework for building multi-agent workflows.

### Core concepts:

1. [**Agents**](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/agents): LLMs configured with instructions, tools, guardrails, and handoffs
2. [**Handoffs**](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/handoffs/): Allow agents to transfer control to other agents for specific tasks
3. [**Guardrails**](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/guardrails/): Configurable safety checks for input and output validation
4. [**Tracing**](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/tracing/): Built-in tracking of agent runs, allowing you to view, debug and optimize your workflows

Explore the [examples](examples) directory to see the SDK in action, and read our [documentation](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) for more details.

Notably, our SDK [is compatible](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/models/) with any model providers that support the OpenAI Chat Completions API format.


## The agent loop

When you call `Runner.run()`, we run a loop until we get a final output.

1. We call the LLM, using the model and settings on the agent, and the message history.
2. The LLM returns a response, which may include tool calls.
3. If the response has a final output (see below for more on this), we return it and end the loop.
4. If the response has a handoff, we set the agent to the new agent and go back to step 1.
5. We process the tool calls (if any) and append the tool responses messages. Then we go to step 1.

There is a `max_turns` parameter that you can use to limit the number of times the loop executes.

### Final output

Final output is the last thing the agent produces in the loop.

1.  If you set an `output_type` on the agent, the final output is when the LLM returns something of that type. We use [structured outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) for this.
2.  If there's no `output_type` (i.e. plain text responses), then the first LLM response without any tool calls or handoffs is considered as the final output.

As a result, the mental model for the agent loop is:

1. If the current agent has an `output_type`, the loop runs until the agent produces structured output matching that type.
2. If the current agent does not have an `output_type`, the loop runs until the current agent produces a message without any tool calls/handoffs.

## Common agent patterns

The Agents SDK is designed to be highly flexible, allowing you to model a wide range of LLM workflows including deterministic flows, iterative loops, and more. See examples in [`examples/agent_patterns`](examples/agent_patterns).

## Tracing

The Agents SDK automatically traces your agent runs, making it easy to track and debug the behavior of your agents. Tracing is extensible by design, supporting custom spans and a wide variety of external destinations, including [Logfire](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/integrations/llms/openai/#openai-agents), [AgentOps](https://docs.agentops.ai/v1/integrations/agentssdk), [Braintrust](https://braintrust.dev/docs/guides/traces/integrations#openai-agents-sdk), [Scorecard](https://docs.scorecard.io/docs/documentation/features/tracing#openai-agents-sdk-integration), and [Keywords AI](https://docs.keywordsai.co/integration/development-frameworks/openai-agent). For more details about how to customize or disable tracing, see [Tracing](http://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/tracing), which also includes a larger list of [external tracing processors](http://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/tracing/#external-tracing-processors-list).
